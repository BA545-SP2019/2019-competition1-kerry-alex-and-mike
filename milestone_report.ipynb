However, we all expect to contribute to each step in the process to some degree. Kerry, as group leader, will check in on the progress of each step and help troubleshoot issues to keep the project moving forward. \n"

    "Our next step in the competition will be feature selection. We will utililze correlation analysis as the primary method of our feature selection. Once we have complied our desired features we will continue on to the modeling protion of the competition. We will run a logistic regression and attempt another type of modeling that will statisfy the criteria of the extra credit. We have a coaching session scheduled on Thursday that we will use to ask Dr. Tao any questions we have at that point."
